# Analysis of Polarization Vision in Jalmenus Evagoras

## Introduction
This repository contains a guided walkthrough of the statistical analysis I conducted in our study on polarization vision in the Australian imperial blue butterfly, *Jalmenus evagoras*. Our research investigates how these butterflies utilize polarization vision in mate selection and navigation.

## Datasets and Scripts
- **Datasets**: Available through Dryad [https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kprr4xh6t]
- **Analysis Scripts**: Published on Zenodo [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7139636]

## Statistical Analysis Walkthrough
The following is a step-by-step guide through the statistical analyses performed in our study, accompanied by visualizations of our findings.

### Analysis 1: Reflectance Spectrophotometry
- **Objective**: Measure and compare the polarization properties of male and female wings.
- **Results**: [Insert brief summary of findings]
- **Visualization**: ![Reflectance Spectrophotometry](Images/reflectance_spectrophotometry.png)

### Analysis 2: Polarization Discrimination Experiment
- **Objective**: Determine the ability of *Jalmenus evagoras* to discriminate between different polarization states.
- **Results**: [Insert brief summary of findings]
- **Visualization**: ![Polarization Discrimination](Images/polarization_discrimination.png)

### Analysis 3: Ommatidial Alignment Measurement
- **Objective**: Explore the alignment of ommatidial arrays and its impact on polarization vision.
- **Results**: [Insert brief summary of findings]
- **Visualization**: ![Ommatidial Alignment](Images/ommatidial_alignment.png)

## Conclusion
This repository offers a comprehensive overview of the statistical methodologies and analyses utilized in our study of polarization vision in *Jalmenus evagoras*. Through these analyses, we aim to contribute to the broader understanding of sensory systems in butterflies.
